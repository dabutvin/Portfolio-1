                <h5>CAMS Suicide Prevention</h5>
                <small>CAMS is a suicide prevention therapy where clinicians and patients work
                    together to understand suicidality and come up with a treatment plan. Today, CAMS is completed
                    via a series of paper forms. I have been working with the creator of CAMS and psychiatrists in
                    the Seattle area to bring CAMS to the digital world using digital pens and Microsoft Word so
                    that it can reach more people than ever before.</small>

                <h5>Ink Editor</h5>
                <small>I worked with a team of engineers and designers to improve the Ink Editor
                    feature in Microsoft Word. Ink Editor enables users to edit documents in a more natural way
                    through the use of proofreading gestures. We added new gestures and improved the way the
                    feature works by leveraging insights from user research.</small>
