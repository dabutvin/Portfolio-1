            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Have you ever mistaken a short text response from a friend as anger or indifference? We lose so much
                information about emotion through text messaging. For many people, however, text-based messaging is a
                preferred and primary way of communicating with others. Modern text communication needs to evolve to
                fill in these gaps that can lead to misunderstanding, potentially causing stress and problems with
                relationships.</p>
