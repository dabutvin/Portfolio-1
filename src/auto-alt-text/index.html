            <p>Alternative Text is critical to helping people with vision impairments and cognitive disabilities
                understand graphical content. While emphasis on accessibility is increasing across the tech industry,
                there is still too much digital content that is inaccessible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For more than a decade, Microsoft Office employed an Alt Text experience that is difficult to find,

            <p>I spent time ideating solutions to make Alt Text easier to access, understand, and create.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That's when I came across the newly released Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs, which are able to
                generate natural language descriptions of images using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I thought
                this could be a great opportunity to add machine intelligence to alt text while improving the overall
                experience for both authors and consumers of alt text.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I pitched the idea, and worked with several engineers to prototype a proof of concept during a
                hackathon.</p>

                <p><b>Problem:</b> Machine Learning models are not perfect, and it might be difficult for someone who
                    is blind to understand whether or not they should trust a caption.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Once a description was generated, we appended text that marks the description as
                    being machine generated.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We also included a confidence rating so that screen reader users can make better decisions about
                    trusting the alt text.</p>

                        <p><b>Problem:</b> The Computer Vision model we were using was originally trained almost
                            exclusively with social media content. It was extremely bad at recognizing the professional
                            content that someone would insert into an Office document. We thought this problem might
                            block the entire project from continuing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Solution:</b> We built a web app to help curate a set of nearly 100,000 photos to be used
                            to train the image captioning Machine Learning model. When re-trained, the model
                            demonstrated a 30% increase in coverage in describing a random set of professional photos.</p>

                <p><b>Problem:</b> A key component of intelligent systems is collecting feedback so that the system can
                    improve over time. There are many privacy regulations that prevent gathering the data we would need
                    to improve Automatic Alt Text.</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> We created an opt-in only feedback loop that allows users to donate their images to
                    us. We made sure that we were following privacy guidelines, and that the information given to us
                    was being stored securely.</p>
